***Simple app for doing multi-node testing**

## Overview

This app was built to do multi-node testing of the same DNA from one user interface.

## Install

1. Install the Holochain command line dev tool by following the instructions here: https://developer.holochain.org/start.html

2. Clone this repo:
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/holochain/simple-app
```

3. Make sure things are working by running the tests:

```shell
cd simple-app
hc test
```

4. Compile the DNA and run two instances of it. First, in one terminal window, run:

```shell
hc run --port 8888 --package
```

Then, in another terminal window, run:
```shell
hc run --port 8889
```

Finally to run the UI, simply open the `ui/index.html` file in a browser, and it should start communicating with the two instances of `hc` via websockets.
